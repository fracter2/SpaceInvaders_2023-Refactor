Refactor Summary for the final presentation

Theodor Rydberg


The most common smells and bad practises:

Never using const or constexpr
	- funcs like drawing funcs or math funcs should be const
	- Variables should be (static) constexpr unless obviously changed during runtime,
		like positions. It is confusing when variables like radius may or may
		not be changed during runtime, when it most likely is not intended.

Poor separation of duties 
	- (game.h and game.cpp contain menu-scene, end-scene, leaderboard, 
		each entity logic, math funcs, all rendering, all on top of typical gameplay logic)

Poor file/folder organisation 
	- (level.h/cpp outside Source folder, cloc.exe with unclear purpose)
	- (hitHurt.ogg should have it's own folder for sfx/assets)

Lot's of unused code and unused files 
	- (config.txt and README.md are almost empty)
	- (hitHurt.ogg, cloc.exe and the how-to are not used)
	- (many varaibles are made redundant by an equivalent variable or by being unused)

Raw for-loops that can almost all be reaplced with for-each loops (more readable)

Lot's of printing using std::cout
	- Should nowadays be std::print() for simplicity and clarity
	- Though more importantly, the prints can almost all be removed as they serve 
		little purpose than debugging, and so should be handled using breakpoints or
		put in when fixing the logic. Outside of that they only clutter the output stream.

No constructors!
	- Would abvoid all 2-step init! Of which there is a LOT

Redundant comments!
	- Comments that say the "obvious", re-stating the name of the method.
	- Comments that serve as organizational headers can be fine, "// code" doesn't say much.



Some specific references used:


- cpp core guidelines C12 (Don’t make data members const or references in a copyable or movable type)
	- To avoid using a const reference of the SceneManager in the Scenes
